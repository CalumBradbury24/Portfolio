        Hello I am Calum! A driven and adaptable Masters of Electrical &
        Electronic Engineering (MEng) graduate with a passion for software and
        writing code. Analytically minded and very enthusiastic about
        technology, I have experience in a wide assortment of software and
        programming languages.
        <br />
        <br />
        In my free time I enjoy working on my own technology related personal
        projects (including this website itself), a number of which can be found
        here. I also love to dance! As a Member of the University of Nottingham
        DanceSport Team I have competed in multiple national Ballroom & Latin
        dance competitions. Including the Inter Varsity Dance Championships
        (IVDC) at the Winter Gardens in Blackpool.
