        Hello I am Calum! A Masters of Electrical & Electronic Engineering
        (MEng) graduate with a passion for software and writing code. I am very
        enthusiastic about technology and have a wide range of software and
        hardware experience!
        <br />
        <br />
        In my free time I enjoy working on my own technology related personal
        projects, including this website itself. I also love to dance! As a
        Member of the University of Nottingham DanceSport Team I have competed
        in multiple national Ballroom & Latin dance competitions. Including the
        Inter Varsity Dance Championships (IVDC) at the Winter Gardens in
        Blackpool, UK.
